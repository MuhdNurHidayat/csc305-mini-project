## What is CSC305?
CSC305 is the course code of Programming Paradigm, a subject offered under [CS110,
Diploma in Computer Science](https://fskm.uitm.edu.my/v4/index.php/2015-05-21-01-12-29/2015-05-21-01-19-14/diploma/diploma-in-computer-science-cs110) programme at selected campuses of [Universiti Teknologi MARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universiti_Teknologi_MARA).

## Why there is mini project?
Mini project is part of the ongoing assessment for the course which also contributes to the final grade.
Different lecturers in different campuses might have different requirements for mini projects, some
gives freedom to their students to choose whatever language they want while others
restrict the language. In our case, we're required to do our mini project in Python 2.

## Notice
As written earlier, we're required to do our mini project in **Python 2** (specifically 2.7.12).
Please convert or adapt the code by yourself if you're using other versions of Python.

## Release
The codes were written in 2016, in which the code works without problem and ran
successfully in untested computer in the computer laboratory for our presentation in 2016.

We do notice the online parser has stopped working when we reviewed the code again on 18th April 2018.
However, we do not intend to fix it anymore because our job here is done.
Muhammad Nur Hidayat (muhdnurhidayat), also known as MNH48 is releasing the code on behalf of our team to
the public so that other students could have some reference in writing their own codes.

The screenshots of WhatsApp conversations between Muhammad Nur Hidayat and the rest of team members
are included under `agreement` folder as proof that the files are released under agreement.
However, do note that the conversations are done in Malay because it's our daily and native language.
